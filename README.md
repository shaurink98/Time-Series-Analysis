# Time-Series-Analysis

Welcome to the Time-Series-Analysis project! 

This project is focused on analyzing time series data using various statistical and machine learning techniques. The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive guide to time series analysis, covering everything from data preparation and visualization to forecasting and model evaluation.

This project contains a Jupyter notebook, "Time_Series_Analysis.ipynb", which serves as the main hub for all the analysis. The notebook is written in Python and uses popular libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn. The notebook also includes practical examples and case studies that demonstrate how to apply time series analysis in real-world scenarios.

Thank you for visiting this project, and we hope you find it helpful!
